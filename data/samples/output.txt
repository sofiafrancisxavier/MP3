Content: I was sitting at home watching movies with a friend when we were both hit by a craving for Chinese food. We quickly decided to order some delivery and, based on a variety of reasons (great online reviews, relatively close, not a huge minimum needed), decided to give Shanghai Inn a shot. Ordering was easy. Delivery was extremely quick, and the delivery guy was friendly and super nice. First, our appetizers. The crab rangoon were, in a word, awesome. They arrived piping hot and super crispy with a creamy and flavorful filling. The egg drop soup was also very good - not too salty, lots of egg, generally delicious. Unfortunately, our main courses just weren't good. My moo shu pork was...well...it was bad. The pancakes were the right thinness and consistency, but the sauce was super thick and gloopy and basically tasted like salt. The other problem was the lack of pork. My moo shu pork was very skimpy on the meat and was mostly vegetables, primarily cabbage. What little meat there was was incredibly chewy. It looks like my search for good moo shu will continue. My friend's chicken lo mein had a similar problem. Lots of noodles, mushrooms, peapods, a few water chestnuts, but almost no chicken. In fact, she found only two pieces of chicken in the entire container. She also complained about how salty it was, and she said that it was a bit too greasy.

Content: Neptune is a cute little restaurant located in North End, but just like I found several other places in the area, it was small and crowded. At 3pm on a Monday, my boyfriend and I dropped in and were seated within the first few minutes of standing around. Although, that was after we were asked to get up from the empty seats at the bar just to be re-seated there a minute later. So note to self: don't sit down anywhere unless the hostess or bartender allows you sit in that area. But in the end, the service was great and our bartender/waitress was awesome. I had a field day at the raw bar and tried almost everything on their list. My favorites were:* Kumamoto - small oyster but don't underestimate how delicious these are. They're extremely plumped and super sweet, with a creaminess that just melts in your mouth. It's description says that the Kumamoto gives a honeydew melon finish and it does not disappoint. Hands down my favorite of the bunch.* Kusshi - another oyster not to underestimate or overlook due to its size. The cucumber finish was immediate, and the description of "low salt and sweet" was defined correctly. * Shrimp Cocktail - this was huge! It filled me up 100%. I didn't think the shrimp was as tender as others that I've had but it was SO HUGE, I am not holding anything against it.* Jonah Crab Claws - MUST HAVE. I can't even put in words how delicious the claw was... it was just that wonderful!!I say skip the clams. Not worth it, and the littleneck clams taste so much better in a clam chowder, but not by itself. And speaking of chowder, pass here. I'm a fan of traditional chowder (you know... thick and chowder-y), but Neptune's Clam Chowder was like clam potato soup. It was extremely oily and had way too much potatoes and not enough clams. The taste was good but I don't think it was worth the $11. That money would've been better spent ordering more Kumamoto oysters.

Content: This place is all hype!  Thankfully we arrived around 5:45 on a Wed so getting the disappointing meal wasn't as hard as eating it.  Parked right outback, walked right in, ordered, and was seated in about 10 minutes.  Thats the positive.  Now the food ......Brisket, not Smokey nor juicy, kind of bland in fact. Pulled pork also lacked smoke and flavor.  Don't try to add flavor to the meat by dousing it in sauce either!  The vinegar based sauce is the work of amateurs.Ribs were only OK.  Nothing special.The beans had allot of smoke flavor!  The chemical liquid smoke variety.  It was obvious by the texture of the beans that someone was trying to make up for the lack of cook time.

Content: This was our last meal on our Chicago trip and we chose it after hearing great things about this place from our friend who used to live in the area. My husband and I came for an early dinner and the restaurant was pretty empty and quiet. We shared the following: - Avocado crostini: so tasty!! It's a delicious and light appetizer great for sharing! So fresh and delicious! Honestly, it's very simple and I could probably make this at home, but I had no regrets ordering it. Definitely recommend this one! - Lobster ravioli: I was pretty disappointed by this dish. It was a little on the bland side, and I wished it had more of a lemony citrusy flavor. - Pumpkin ravioli w/ butternut squash: delicious!!! I loved this dish. The flavor is amazing! It's seriously like autumn on a plate. Sweet, savory, and the sage is just perfection! One of the best pasta dishes I've ever had! - Panna cotta: this was definitely not your average panna cotta. It was actually a chocolate flavor which took me by surprise. They nailed the texture though! Overall, the panna cotta was good, but a little too rich for my personal liking. If you like desserts like decadent chocolate pudding, get this. Service was phenomenal! 5 stars for the service alone. The manager and server both took great care of us throughout the night. We felt like honorary guests! I would recommend this place just based on the amazing hospitality and service we received.

Content: I had such high expectations. After hearing only good things about Quartino I ended up disappointed. The food just really wasn't that good. I came with a group of friends for a birthday, but no one was that impressed. The pasta dishes were decent, but I felt like I could have made them at home. The fondue was okay, but rather bland. The noise level is also pretty loud. This usually doesn't bother me, but so so food coupled with a so so atmosphere just equals a so so experience. I probably will not go back, especially since there are so many better options in the area.

Content: The potee was awesome! I'm still craving it 2 weeks later! It included pork tenderloin, pork belly and pork sausage. We also got a butternut squash 'ravioli' that was good and a seafood stew which was okay but not great. Service was okay but a little spotty.

Content: I went in a bit cautious but was won over. When a restaurant receives a lot of hype such as this I think it's either really as good as people say or the majority of diners are simply saying the food is good bc they're engaging in groupthink. Well, after having dinner at the Publican, I can confirm that it's the former. I wouldnt say everything we had was a hit, but I will say I love the fresh food and the variety of dishes served. So here's a rundown of what we had:Halibut crudo: This was very good and I would definitely recommend ordering it. I thought it was very fresh and light. A great dish to start off with.Potted rillettes: Loved this. Prob my fav dish of the night. Have ya'll noticed how restaurants never seem to give enough bread with spreads? Luckily, we had asked for bread at the beginning of dinner, so when we ran out of the toasted bread that came with the dish we simply spread the rillettes over the complimentary bread we received earlier. Honestly, I really dont know how the cherries enhanced or complimented the rillettes. Even without the cherries, this dish wouldve been yummy.Country ribs: This was another hit. I could really taste the citrus flavor in the meat. And there were two large chunks of meat, so portion size was great. The slices of oranges scattered throughout the dish didnt really do anything to enhance the flavor of the meat but I guess it was just there for presentation's sake.Livornese fish stew: Served with what I believe to be garlic bread. I generally love fish stew, but I'd say skip this one. I've had better at Calo. It wasnt bad (although a tad salty), but as I've said Ive had better elsewhere so I'd save my money for something else on the menu. I certainly dont believe it was worth $29.We had another dish from the vegetable section of the menu, but I dont recall what it was called. It consisted of eggplant and ground lamb. In regards to this dish, I'd say if you see something similar on the menu, skip it. It tasted like sloppy joe. I've had better manwiches.We also had dessert. A blueberry shortcake with lemon curd and this banana ice cream dessert, the exact term for which I cant remember. Anywho, my fellow dinner mate enjoyed his banana ice cream but I didnt really like my shortcake. Specifically, I didnt like the basil ice cream that was in the dessert. Minus the basil ice cream, I wouldve like this dessert more.In terms of service, our waitress was really helpful, answering any questions we had about items on the menu. I dont really have much to say about the wait staff. I thought they did their job well.Ambiance: We had an early dinner, arriving at the restaurant a little before 530 on a Sunday. Early on it was pretty nice and quiet, but it slowly got louder and louder as more and more diners sat down for dinner. I had expected this so no complaints. I just know to show up early to avoid the noisier atmosphere.

Content: My mouth is watering writing this review. Omg, these tacos are EVERYTHING and then some,imo. Los Tacos offers no tables to sit at, like more than half of the other spots at the market don't either. The line was composed of about 40 people when I got there, and the wait was probably about 10-15 minutes.... but the wait is extremely worth it. Their steak and pork tacos are fantastic. Their pico de gallo is tangy, but not over the top spicy. Holy crap. These are by far the fastest and tastiest tacos that have ever graced my mouth. Their pork tacos have freaking pineapple in them? I've never had this combo and I'm dying to have some more of them right now. The employees are really friendly and move efficiently fast. The price? about $3 dollars a taco. WHAT? yes. The tacos are made by a Mexican staff? YES! That's probably why they're so damn good. Something to keep in mind though, after you pay and receive your ticket, move quickly to the other side and give that other person your ticket. If you assume that after you pay, your ticket number or order will be called out for you to come get it, you will be waiting there for a longgggggg time.

Content: In the basement of United Nations building, this restaurant feels like an upscale izakaya. We sat in a middle booth. We ordered draft Sapporo ($7) which came with 2 inches of foam and in a less than a pint size glass. The service was fairly slow but not unbearable once we got our full bottle of unfiltered shirakawago sake. The bottle was set on the table on ice in a beautiful wooden container with flower. We ordered: Sashimi: Tuna, amberjack, mackerel, red snapper, and salmon with iruka (instead of the uni) b/c [my dinner mates are not adventurous eaters]. Each piece was spectacularly thick and supple. The roe on the salmon was best I have ever eaten. It was sweet with a touch of brine instead of the other way around. A+ for presentation. Tuna Tartare with yellow and black masago on a bed of thinly sliced cucumbers. Roasted Duck slices served cold and wrapped around a bundle of soy marinated Daikon topped with a dot of pea sauce and half moon lemon slices. This dish is about contrast. The fatty and chewy meat plays excellently against salty crispy radish and the finish of citrus just brightens the bite. Chawamushi: Steam Egg custard with mushroom in a sour chicken broth. It had similar flavor profile to Cantonese hot n sour soup. It is a bit more asian than rest of our food order. We had chicken two ways. First was the jidori shioyaki. Crispy chicken skin. Grilled served with salt and miso.  Second was the tori-karaage which a fancy term for fried chicken. Five almost too big pieces of poultry. I am not sure why lofan people always leave the vegetal side. The lettuce with the fried chicken was less decadent. Beef. We had the signature ishiyaki which was thinly sliced beef slices cooked on top of a hot stone. (See the video). We also had the steak which paled in comparison. Finally NOODLES. Inaniwa Udon served hot in a clear broth. It was so refreshing eating just noodles, broth, and spinach. The noodles were Al dente and very slurp-able. The broth was light and fresh but had firm flavor.  This is what you should order. Dessert. Black sesame creme br?l��e with black sesame ice cream.  Not so much burnt sugar but the Asian twist on this french dessert was rather delicious.

Content: Alinea may as well be called "Alien-a" because it's simply an OUT OF THIS WORLD culinary experience!!!Haha that was cheesy.  Onward...Not too long ago I watched the Andrew Zimmern Bizarre Foods episode where he dined at Alinea.  I was fascinated by the crazy contraptions used to create their culinary creations and immediately put this restaurant on my "must try sometime in my life" list.  Then I realized it was also a 3-starred Michelin Restaurant. THEN I was sent to a work trip out to Chicago.  AND my boyfriend just happened to have a work trip that brought him out to Chicago the same week.  Needless to say it was meant to be for us two foodies to pay this place a visit."Subtle" would be the word I have for this location, but I'm too excited about the food so I'm diving right in (there ARE 22 dishes, after all).The first course composed of 3 mini-servings of "frozen drinks", all meant to be consumed in a single bite.1) Lemon - luxardo bitter, luxardo amaro, grapefruit:  a frozen bite of liquor lifted with a delicate pin - a bit bitter for me but a good refreshing start to the meal.2) Apple - laird's apple brandy, grenadine, thyme: a piece of crunchy apple encapsulated in a jelly liquor served on a circular spoon - once again a foreign and enlightening experience for the taste buds3) Squash - cynar, carpano antica, flor de cana 7 year: served on a mini tower, a flan-like substance with a tasty foam.  This was my favorite of the three, likely because it was the sweetest.4) Steelhead Roe - dijon, retabaga, grapefruit:  creamy, full of "umami", zero hint of fishiness paired with the essence of grapefruit.. simply delicious. 5) Yuba - Shrimp, miso, togarashi: a crunchy twist of fried tofu skin, wrapped with tender shrimp and dipped in a perfectly seasoned miso sauce.  The asian side of me is comforted by this little "snack".6) Urchin - watercress, vanilla, mint: A vanilla "jello" of sorts encapsulating a small piece of sea urchin.  A small bite exploding in different flavors... I can't even describe this one because it was a medley of the strangest flavors popping in and out of my mouth.  This dish ends with a sip of watercress soup served beneath the jello.7) Halibut - black pepper, coffee, lemon: One of my favorite dishes of the night and presented in a snowy-white art form.  The fish was perfectly cooked, the hint of coffee flavor permeated occasionally, the crunchy "shrimp chips" and the flawless cream sauce played together in a strange, but perfect harmony. YUM.8) Rabbit - Parfait, rillett, consommé: A three-tiered dish (literally, served in a 3 tiered cylindrical bowl) beginning with a cool rabbit parfait on the top layer that was creamy yet refreshing, culminated to a rabbit meat medley (a cube of shredded meat alongside a fried ball of meat) covered in king trumpet mushroom and surrounded by butternut sauce, and finally ending with a clear rabbit broth kept warm by a hot stone and flavored with a stick of cinnamon.9) Wlid mushrooms - pine, sumac, ramp: Loving this mushroom medley of wild mushrooms from the Fresno foothills in CA (what what)... weirdly spongy but super flavorful... another favorite.10) Hot Potato - cold potato, black truffle, butter: Another creative sip of soup served on a mini wax bowl with a pin poking through, spearing a bite of potato, black truffle, and frozen butter.  Pulling the pin releases these items into a cold potato broth... this dish was particularly different.11) Short Rib - olive, red wine, blackberry: Yet another favorite dish.  Earlier during dinner we were presented with 2 red "flags" in criss cross formation, which seemed a strange table decor. At this point we realized that this "flag" was an edible homemade tomato pasta.  This pasta was then draped over a metal, cradlelike contraption that made space for the most tender and tasty short rib I've ever eaten.  A plate of sides and sauces containing sea salt, olives, blackberry, sour cherry were all fair game to garnish this "pasta short rib wrap".  Likely the most luxurious "wrap" I will ever eat; I was blown away.12) Hamachi - West Indies spices, banana, ginger: served on a smoldering piece of cinnamon, this fried dish had a very "Indian" vibe to it although the banana felt like the centerpiece.13) Canard - a la Cussy: Lots of "best of"s during this meal, but this was the BEST DUCK I'VE EVER HAD.  A puff pastry stuffed with duck innards, foie gras, cock's crest (first time trying... it was good), and topped with the 3 most tender slices of duck I've ever had along with a tiny piece of fried duck skin.  I was getting really full at this point but I had to push through... 14) Venison - cherry, cocoa nib, eucalyptus: Once again, most tender piece of venison I've ever had.  Not gamey, served on a "lily pad" like presentation that covered the bite of deer heaven.To be continued... yelp's 5000 word limit can't stop me...

Content: It's going to be long.  Must be brief to fit the experience in 5001 characters.Alinea is a special occasion kinda place.  Before you can dine here you must get a reservation here.  The trick is they open up reservations two months in advance so if you want to eat in March you better call Jan 1 to snag that spot up (especially if it's a weekend).  You've got your reservations? Great!It's located in a building that's pretty nondescript.  During the day my friend described it as..."shady looking."  In the evening there will be a tiny sign for Valet Service ($11).  Unless you're lucky and there's a spot open, why not just Valet (You're already splurging on this epic meal.)  Oh yea...formal jackets required...don't be a bum!The interior looks like an upscale office.  Tell them your name and reservation time and off you go to your seats!  They'll take your valet card so they can prep your car when your meal is ending or call you a cab if that's the route you went.  Service!  They only do wines so don't expect cocktails.  Wine pairings ranged from 160 to 250.  Ok Food!  Warning that there will be some spoilers!Steelhead Roe sitting on a bed of watermelon mousse, wrapped in watermelon flesh and finished off with watermelon consume poured in with an edible flower.  Wonderful starter that was mostly sweet, but light elements of savory.Hamachi bite that had pineapple salt, ginger, west indie spices, and kaffir lime with Vanilla Bean Stick for holder.  Complex flavors here.  It was sweet, but also sour from the kaffir, then salty and rich from the hamachi.  Another good opening to get your tastebuds going.At this point they brought out what looked like fruit rollups and set them down and told us we'd deal with them later...intrigue!The next dish was a quad that we were supposed to eat in a specific order.  The presentation was these 4 shellfish sitting on kelp sitting on this driftwood.Oyster Leaf topped with a mignonette.  Leaves that taste like oysters!Taylor Bay Scallop with old bay oil and a white ale foam.  One of the highlight bites of the night.  The scallop was juicy and firm and had an overall richness of flavor.Top Neck Clam with an xo sauce and carrot and ginger tapiocas.  This reminded me of Asian cuisine with the xo sauce and the salty flavors.Mussel with saffron, chorizo, and orange.  The mussel was sitting in the shell and the other flavors were these cubes that sat on top of it so as you chewed the flavors got intense based on which cube you were hitting.Yuba (tofu skin) with shrimp and a miso mayo dip.  They dried it, rolled it up, and deep fried it to create a stick then wrapped a shrimp around it and placed it in a holder that had a well of miso mayo dipping sauce.  Chip and dip!Mackerel bite with juniper, radish flower, and mango.  We were just to chomp down and slide the bite off the wire.  Great layers to the flavors.  Salty richness from the mackeral moving down to the sweet mango.Wild Mushrooms dish.  A mixture of wild mushrooms with sumac, pine, and ramps.  The mushrooms individually had great earthy flavors, but it didn't come together as a whole for me.Hot Potato, cold potato, black truffle, butter...one of the winners of the night.  Small wax bowl with a wire in it that has a potato sphere with a black truffle cap, a cube of butter, and a cube of something else.  You pull the wire out so everything falls in and then take the whole bite.  Wow, great bite.Lamb Loin with lamb jous reduction and béarnaise along with mini potato spheres.  There were 2 small lamb loin medallions topped with a slice of artichoke heart and 2 small asparagus tips.  This sat on a crunchy, flaky disc.  On the center and sides were the jous and sauce to dip in.Short Rib, olive, fermented garlic, fresh blackberry, smoked salt, white wine radish, tobacco agar...this is where those flags come in play.  Make your own wrap with all this stuff.  Also you get to make the holder for the tomato pasta and the engineer in me got happy.Black Truffle explosion.  Winner!  Single bit of ravioli with liquid truffle inside...that is allOctopus with eggplant mousse and soup.  Also great, the mousse was awesome.Yuzu Snow.  Palette cleanser.  Sprayed yuzu mist over a super cold dish to create snow.  You scrape to create a granita.  Refreshing.Peach, jasmine, basil, balsamic, mozzarella cubes.  Think caprese salad.  Basil cubes and mozzarella ice cream were win.Lemongrass juice, dragonfruit, and herbs.  A tube where you sucked down this refreshing liquid.Chocolate mousse, red pepper, bitter orange, banana rum brulee, and rum cake.  The chefs came out to create this art on the table for us.  The mousse was frozen in liquid nitro.  Lots of fun to watch and eat!Servers were warm, funny, joked with us.  It was awesome.  They told us we were sitting at Zac Efron's table but were more fun.  Our sommelier was passionate, knowledgeable, and talked like a motorboat.  Running out of chars.  So TRY IT!

Content: Curiously, the top restaurant in the US (2010/2011) lies in the quaint and unpretentious neighbourhood of Lincoln Park. The only tell-tale sign was the valet notice and doorman standing by the bare doors. I was greeted by a narrow neon red hallway and my world was suddenly transformed once the metal doors opened. The hostesses and servers operated seamlessly. After reconfirming our lack of dietary restrictions, our courses came promptly, one after another. All 20 of it.A set of 3 cocktail amuse bouche opened our tastebuds. A cooling sour lemon with sweet grapefruit, a spoonful of apple brandy hard jello and a shot on a stool of squash with foam on top.  Each one seems to be progressively stronger in alcohol taste. The GOLDEN TROUT ROE had light coconut flavours , and the zest of tangy-sweet pineapple.  What an interesting and unique combination of flavor that will always remind me of Chef Achatz!The Japanese inspired YUBA was a long crunchy twig that was wrapped with shrimp, sprinkled with sesame seeds and dipped with miso. Presented alongside with the Vietnamese inspired CHAO TOM which is a sugar cane cube infused with shrimp broth, topped with mint and chewed until the flavours are extracted. A beautiful twist to the traditional Vietnamese dish!The STRIPED BASS was complimented perfectly with sweet vanilla froth and sourness.  A pinch of black pepper and sesame, along with the light crackers gives it the crunch that contrasts flawlessly with the supple fish.A shot of CELERY JUICE held a shell of horseradish ball encasing apple juice. What an exotic flavor from everyday fruit and vegetable! The horseradish was slightly spicy like wasabi (which is made of horseradish) and the celery juice and apple juice mixed well together. A distinctive three layered dish of RABBIT Top layer; eat it like a parfait, a sheet of squash and pine nuts were accompanied by thin crunchy stems. Then rabbit rillette was accompanied by balls of potatoes? Afterwards, sip on the consommé made from the rich broth that soaked the cinnamon stick. Unfortunately, I thought this was a little salty for my liking.A smoky aroma filled the room; it was from the burning fig that held the PHEASANT TEMPURA with walnuts together. Light crunch, very unique and the pheasant was very tender but I'm not a big fan of walnuts. One of the most interesting dish was the create-your-own SHORT-RIB RAVIOLI with a variety ingredients of your choice! Including sea salt, olives, blackberry, onion etc. I made sure to put everything in my wrap. It was delicious, and the chilled pasta wrap was warmed by the slow braised short rib. The creativity and hands on experience does not end here!Next up was a shot of temperature sensitive POTATO with black truffle. Warm truffle paired with icy cold potato and mushroom. What a scrumptious sensation!Then our server poured us a GRAPE SODA to match with the extremely tender PIGEONNEAU on a light puff pastry. BLACK TRUFFLE EXPLOSION blew up in my mouth! Keep your lips shut for this as you don't want luscious rich truffle spilling out of your lips! Cheesy, creamy truffle. MMM! A spoonful was delectable and satisfying.To pave the way to desserts, an unusual sweet-savory set of three came. A PINEAPPLE SUGAR SHEET dusted with ham flavoured powder. Be sure to eat it with the powder facing up and you'll keep the table powder-free! Slightly sugary, more savory. A crispy bacon glazed with butterscotch and a cup of liquefied caramel popcorn made a sweet drink. An exquisite transition from main course to dessert!An inflated pillow infused with earl grey permeated the room while we cut up EARL GREY COOKIE topped with white chocolate and crunchy strips. My favourite dessert is the tube of bubble gum flavoured CREME FRAICHE. Jelly like in the tube, suck it out and all three layers combined. A chewy consistency of mini tapioca balls and fruity-bubblegum flavoured. Ending the night was the full blown dessert, a CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM frozen by liquid nitrogen. Surrounded by huckleberries, nougat and a dollop of vanilla cream. The crisp sheet decorating the final piece stood out from the soft and cooling ice cream. Service was impeccable. Napkins replaced, water droplets and crumbs wiped off, each course explained thoroughly, and came and left in a syncronised fashion, gracefully and efficiently.***Tip: Business formal dress code suggested. We made reservations at least a month in advance. Cancellation costs $100 per person! Tasting menu was not that filling but still left me about 80% full. I liked being there at 5pm because we were the first ones to get seated and we were the first ones to get our food. Favourites: Very friendly service, not pretentious at all. Expensive but not disgustingly unaffordable.Do not want: I wanted a little more red meat =p Last words: What an EXPERIENCE!
